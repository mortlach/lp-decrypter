## General info
An LP brute-forcing tool for decrypting cipher-text with user defined keys and 
functions of two runes:   
`Function(plaintext_rune,key_rune) = cipher_rune`     
including automated Gematria rotations, interrupters, key-dragging and 
plaintext ranking.    
Very much in early access.     
Send bugs, errors, suggestions and comments to the discord / irc.  
Much more information, benchmarking, features and manual to follow.   
Good Luck
